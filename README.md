# example-zig-webserver
Just trying to write an example webserver in Zig.

## Requirements

* Nix

## Development

Start a new development shell, from the root dir.

```
nix develop
```

> To add more packages to the devshell, simply add them to the `devshell.toml`'s `packages` field.

## Run

Simply run

```
nix run github:tfadeyi/example-zig-webserver
```

If you already cloned the repository just run, from the root of the repo.

```
nix run
```
